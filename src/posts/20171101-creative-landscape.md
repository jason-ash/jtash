excerpt: I transitioned from a role as an actuarial consultant into the world of fintech a few years ago. The actuarial profession is relatively small and extremely specialized, but I believe actuarial methods and insights can play a significant role in the burgeoning fintech field. I wrote an article for <u>The Actuary</u> magazine summarizing the fintech landscape and the role that actuaries should be playing in it.

I was extremely proud to be featured as the lead article in this issue of <u>The Actuary</u> magazine, titled "Creative Landscape". You can read my <a href="https://theactuarymagazine.org/creative-landscape/">full article here</a>, and read the <a href="https://theactuarymagazine.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/act-2017-vol15-iss5.pdf">entire issue here</a>.

This was an exciting issue of <u>The Actuary</u> because of the fintech and insurtech focus. The other authors in this issue represent a small but passionate group of actuaries and other professionals trying to push the limits of traditional insurance and banking, and this issue represents their perspectives well.
