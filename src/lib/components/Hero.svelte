    <strong>Hello! I'm Jason.</strong> I'm a data scientist, actuary, and self-taught software
    engineer based in San Francisco. Currently I lead the enterprise data & analytics team
    at Symetra, an insurance company.

    I created this site to share the things I'm interested in. You'll find posts
    explaining how I built this site, how I write code and solve puzzles using Python,
    and how I use math to understand the world - like using Bayesian inference to analyze
    my daily step count before and after I got a German Shepherd puppy. You can find me
    on Twitter or Github - let's start a conversation!
