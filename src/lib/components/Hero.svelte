    <strong>Hello! I'm Jason.</strong> I'm a data scientist, actuary, and self-taught software
    engineer based in San Francisco. Currently I lead the data & analytics team at Symetra,
    an insurance company.

    I created this site to share the things I'm interested in. You'll find posts
    explaining how I built this site, how I write code and solve puzzles using Python,
    and how I use math to understand the world - like using Bayesian inference to analyze
    my daily step count before and after I got a German Shepherd puppy. You can also find
    me on Twitter or Github - let's start a conversation!

      ðŸš§ Quick note - I've been working on a redesign of this site, but it's a work in
      progress. Feel free to poke around, but beware there might be a few sharp edges! ðŸš§
